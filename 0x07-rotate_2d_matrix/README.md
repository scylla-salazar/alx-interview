0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
Algorithm
Python


For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python.

Tasks
0. Rotate 2D Matrix
mandatory
Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

Prototype: def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited in-place.
You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
