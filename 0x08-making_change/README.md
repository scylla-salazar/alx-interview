0x08. Making Change


For the “0. Change comes from within” project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.


Tasks
0. Change comes from within
mandatory
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

Prototype: def makeChange(coins, total)
Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
If total is 0 or less, return 0
If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
Your solution’s runtime will be evaluated in this task
